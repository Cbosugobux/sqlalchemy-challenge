All Code is property or Chris Bushelman - Created for EdX Bootcamp Module 10 Challenge

In this module, using sqlalchemy, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, Flask and other python modules, we were tasked with creating an app to give us information about the weather in Hawaii.  

First, using Jupyter Notebook and python modules along with a sqllite database, we created an engine to query data in the database.  

Using sqlalchemy, we queried the database for "date" and "prcp" values, we then plotted them into a visualization using matplotlib and pandas.

We also used pandas to create summary statistics for the selected data.

Next, we had to design a query to find the number of active stations in the data, followed by finding the most active station.

Using the data from the most active station we created a visualization of the previous 12 months of temperatures observed at the most active station.

In the second half of the activity we had to create a "Climate App" where we created endpoints for an api for this weather data.

Using VScode, I created several apis that returned jsons of the queries (similar and slightly different) of the data in the first half of the challenge.
